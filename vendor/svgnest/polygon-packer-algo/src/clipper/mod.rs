//! # Clipper Module
//!
//! Polygon clipping and offsetting operations based on the Clipper library.
//! This module provides robust geometric operations for polygon manipulation,
//! including clipping, offsetting, and boolean operations on polygons.
//!
//! The implementation is based on Angus Johnson's Clipper library and provides
//! high-performance polygon operations essential for NFP calculations.
